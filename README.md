Swiss Army Knife website

  This is a small website I made using NodeJS as a way to practice my front and backend skills, as well as challenge myself to see what kind of quality I'm capable of right now. I'm still not satisfied with the result(there's plenty in this project that could be improved, but if I keep tinkering with it I'll never move on XD), but I believe this project served its purpose, and is still a fair showcase of my capabilities.

Requirements
  - Axios 1.6.7 or better
  - EJS 3.1.9 or better
  - Express 4.18.3 or better
  - Node.js 20.11.1 or better
  - NPM recommended

Installation
  After unzipping, run the following command on the root of the project to install all dependencies:

    npm install

  Afterward, simply run the following, again inside the project root, to boot the server:

    node index.js

  The server listens on port 3000 for connections. This can be changed at the PORT constant in line 35 of index.js if so desired.
